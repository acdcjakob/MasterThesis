Phase-pure depositon of \agao\ on \cro\ thin films was achieved for \textit{c}-, \textit{r}-, \textit{m}- and \textit{a}-plane oriented \alo\ substrates.
The orientation of both \cro\ and \agao\ thin film was the same as the respective substrate.
For \textit{ex situ} deposition of \gao, XRD measurements indicate the presence of the \textbeta-phase of \gao, which is less dominant as the still remaining \textalpha-phase.
No optimization was performed for the deposition process, but the results serve as a proof of concept that the deposition of phase-pure \agao\ -- especially in the \textit{c}- and \textit{r}-orientation -- is possible on \cro\ buffer layers.
