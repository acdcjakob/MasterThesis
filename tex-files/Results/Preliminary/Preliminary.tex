\section{Growth Window for \texorpdfstring{\cro}{Cr2O3}\ Deposition on Sapphire}
    \label{Sec:Results_Preliminary}
%! Motivation / Intro
In the first part of this work, the feasibility of depositing \cro\ thin films via \gls{pld} as well as their resulting physical properties are investigated.
Because \cro\ is the most stable chromium oxide, its formation is expected, but other oxidation states cannot be excluded.
E.g., in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_2_photoTarget}, a silver colored target coating can be observed, presumably corresponding to metallic \ce{CrO2}.
If \cro\ is the only oxidation state, then amorphous or rhombohedral films are expected, because no other polymorph of \cro\ exists.
Furthermore, it is investigated whether \alo\ and \cro\ exhibit the same crystal orientation.
Finally, deposition parameters should be optimized to obtain the best crystal quality.
