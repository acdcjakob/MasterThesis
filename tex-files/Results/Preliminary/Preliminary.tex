\section{Preliminary Investigations}
    \label{Sec:Results_Preliminary}
%! Motivation / Intro
In the following, the feasibility of depositing \cro\ thin films via \gls{pld} as well as their resulting physical properties are investigated.
Because \cro\ is the most stable chromium oxide, its formation is expected, but other oxidation states cannot be excluded.
E.g., in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_2_photoTarget}, a silver colored target coating can be observed, presumably corresponding to metallic \ce{CrO2}.
If \cro\ is the only oxidation state, then amorphous or rhombohedral films are expected, because no other polymorph of \cro\ exists.
Furthermore, if a crystalline phase is present, the orientation with respect to the sapphire substrates is of interest.
Because \alo\ and \cro\ exhibit the same crystal symmetry, it is expected that the crystal orientation of the film  matches the corresponding substrate orientation.
Finally, deposition parameters should be optimized to obtain the best crystal quality.
