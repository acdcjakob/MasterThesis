\textit{m}-plane \cro\ thin films can be deposited over a wide range of oxygen partial pressure of more than 2 orders of magnitude.
It turned out that the main influence on the crystal quality correlates with the growth rate and is due to a variation of the laser pulse fluence on the target.
Nevertheless, an oxygen partial pressure of \qty{1e-3}{\milli\bar} and a growth temperature of \qty{750}{\degreeCelsius} are chosen for deposition of subsequent thin films.
\textalpha-\cro\ could also deposited on \textit{c}-, \textit{r}- and \textit{a}-plane sapphire, with the thin films crystallizing in the respective orientation.
Note that all deposited thin films showed a discrepancy between observed \gls{oop}\ lattice plane distance and values predicted from Tab.\,\ref{Tab:sesquiLatticeConstants}.
The conductivity is strongly dependent on the crystal orientation and was very low for the prismatic orientations, but with \qty{0.3}{\siemens\per\cm} three orders of magnitude higher for the basal orientation.
