In the following, the results for the three samples produced at different growth temperatures are presented.
In addition to the oxygen partial pressure, the influence of growth temperature is investigated.  
%! 2theta-omega
Similar to the previous results, the (30.0) reflection of the \textalpha-phase of \cro\ can be observed (Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_temperature_2theta}).
% Note that the additional peaks are corresponding to the (30.0) reflection of the substrate and stem from various radiation wavelengths.
The calculated \gls{oop}\ strain is shown in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_pressureTemperature_yyaxis_strainOmega}b and a large spread of strain can be observed, varying between \qtylist{0.4;1}{\percent}.
Note that there is no systematic dependence on growth temperature.

        \thetaomega-pattern of \cro\ thin films deposited on \textit{m}-plane sapphire for three different growth temperatures.
        The gray solid lines indicate (30.0) substrate reflections corresponding to copper radiation, whereas the gray dashed lines indicate (30.0) substrate reflections corresponding to tungsten radiation.
        The red line corresponds to the predicted (30.0) reflection of \cro.

%! omega
The \textomega-FWHMs of the \cro\ (30.0) reflection are shown in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_pressureTemperature_yyaxis_strainOmega}b and exhibit a similar spread as the samples with varying oxygen partial pressure, but similar to the \gls{oop}\ strain, no dependence on growth temperature is observed.
%! phi-scan
The \textphi-scans (Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_phiScan}) show that the thin films are in-plane aligned with the respective substrate and that no rotational domains are present.
%! growth rate
Finally, the growth rate varies between \qtylist{3.5;10}{\pm\per\pulse} with no observable dependence on growth temperature.
