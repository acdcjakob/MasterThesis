%! theta-omega strain
In Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensStrain}, the \gls{oop}\ strain for the \textit{m}- and \textit{a}-plane oriented samples of the 1st batch (laser spot size variation) is depicted.
The maximum strain which is reached for high fluences is approx.\ \qtylist{0.8;1.5}{\percent} for \textit{m}- and \textit{a}-plane, respectively.
Those values are far below the predicted values for pseudomorphic growth, which are \qty{3.67}{\percent} (\textit{m}-plane) and \qty{3.63}{\percent} (\textit{a}-plane).
This indicates relaxed growth.
In Fig.\,\ref{Fig:App_3_lensStrain_zoomed} it can be seen that for higher thicknesses, the strain reduces only very slightly.
The \textit{m}-plane outlier at a thickness of \qty{25}{\nm} can be explaind by the very low peak intensity of the (30.0) reflection in the \thetaomega\ pattern, which causes a larger uncertainty for this value.
Overall, the fluence is the determining parameter for the strain, allowing strain values of down to \qty{0}{\percent} for \textit{a}-plane samples.

%! omega
In Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensOmega}, the \textomega-FWHM for both \textit{m}- and \textit{a}-plane samples is depicted.
For \textit{m}-plane, the \textomega-FWHM is approx.\ \qty{50}{\arcminute} for all fluences and thicknesses -- only a small decrease for higher thicknesses is oberserved.
As a result, in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensCorrelation}, two regimes of high and low fluence can be distinguished, where each regime itself comes with a correlation indicating better crystallinity with less strain.
However, alltogether, a slight negative correlation can be observed, i.e.\ better crystallinity comes at the cost of higher strain.
For \textit{a}-plane samples, no significant dependence on fluence can be observed.
On the contrary, there seems to be an increase in \textomega-FWHM for increasing thicknesses up to approx.\ \qty{100}{\nm}.
This behavior differs from all other orientations observed and could be attributed to an unusual shape of the \textomega-patterns.
In Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lens_a-weirdOmega}, such a pattern is depicted and has clearly no \textsc{Voigt}-shape.
Rather, the pattern consists of an exponential tail (linear in logarithmic intensity axis) for about \qty{1.5}{\degree} and a very sharp 2nd peak with a small \gls{FWHM} on top of it.
This shape is observed for almost every \textit{a}-plane sample, as can be seen by the various diffractograms shown in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:App_3_lens_omega}.
The sharp peak is located at the maximum of the underlying broader peak and can therefore not be attributed to \ce{Al2O3} or another phase of \cro, because then it would not shift together with the (22.0) peak of the \textalpha-phase of \cro.
This is also supported by the fact that no anomaly is observed in the \thetaomega-patterns (not shown).
This behavior has previously been observed for \ce{ZnO} thin films grown on \textit{c}-plane silicon
    \cite{cho2005,durand2011}.
There, the broader peak contribution is attributed to a degradation at the interface region
    \cite{cho2005}
and the sharp peak is present for a weakly disordered film, where the misfit to the substrate is damped through the underlying film.
As shown by \textcite{durand2011}, the \textomega-FWHM of the narrow peak is limited by the instrumental resolution -- they could resolve a broadening of 5 arcseconds for this peak.
This behavior has also been observed for \textit{c}-plane oriented \cro\ thin films fabricated by \acrshort{pld}
    \cite{arca2017}.
In Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lens_a-weirdOmega}b, several \textomega-patterns are depicted for thin films of different thickness.
For a layer thickness of \qty{30}{\nm}, a broad peak with an overlaying higher intensity peak is observable, which is not narrow but exhibits a plateau with a width of approx.\,\qty{0.25}{\degree}.
For increasing film thicknesses, the FWHM of both the broader and narrow peak decrease, confirming the growth of a higher crystalline layer.
Henceforth, the crystallinity of \textit{a}-plane \cro\ thin films should be assessed by a two-layer model when determining the FWHM of the corresponding \textomega\ patterns.

% Note that the diffractograms stem from different samples, which were also fabricated with different laser fluences, which makes the comparison difficult and the origin of the 2nd peak not entirely clear.
% This could explain the broad spread of \textomega-FWHM (\qty{15}{\arcminute} to \qty{80}{\arcminute}) for \textit{a}-plane samples as well as that the \textomega-FWHM follows a different relation to fluence and thickness when compared to the other orientations.
