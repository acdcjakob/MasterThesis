%! measurements
\comment{\thetaomega-scans were performed for every sample, but \textomega-scans for \textit{c}- and \textit{r}-plane samples only.
The thickness was determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry.
Resistivity measurements at room temperature were done using the \textsc{Pauw} method, which was also applied when conducting temperature dependent resistivity measurements on one \textit{c}-plane sample of each target.
Note that the effect of infrequent cleaning of the laser entrance window that was described in \ref{Sec:Results_Preliminary} was discovered during the execution of those experiments, which is why the samples produced from the ZnO-doped (high) target were the only ones for which this effect could be prevented.
Furthermore, \qty{40000}{pulses} were applied for the samples fabricated from the CuO-doped and ZnO-doped (low) target, as well as one sample from the batch made with the ZnO-doped (high) target.
All other samples from this batch were deposited with \qty{30000}{pulses}.}
