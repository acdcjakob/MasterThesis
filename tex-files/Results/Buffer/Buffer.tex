%! Motivation
A major motivation for investigating \cro\ thin films is due to a possible usage as buffer layer for \agao, which has similar lattice parameters.
This could improve the crystal quality of the latter due to reduced lattice mismatch when compared to \ce{Al2O3}
    \cite{stepanov2021}.
From Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_4_LatticeConstantsComp} it becomes clear that \cro\ has a larger $c$ lattice constant, but a smaller $a$ lattice constant than \agao.
Therefore, e.g., the in-plane compressive strain observed for \textit{c}-plane \cro\ thin films actually further decreases the mismatch between \cro\ and \agao.
For \textit{m}-plane samples, however, the in-plane compressive strain yields a larger discrepancy between the $a$ lattice constant of both sesquioxides.
In the following, a proof of concept will be given that \agao\ can successfully be deposited on \cro\ buffer layers.
