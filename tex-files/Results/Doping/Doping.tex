The resistivity of the \cro\ thin films showed strong dependence on thin film orientation.
To improve and taylor the conductivity, it is tried to incorporate acceptors into the \textit{p}-type material.
The elements chosen for this are \ce{Cu} and \ce{Zn}, because doping has already been accomplished on \textit{c}-plane sapphire with magnesium via \ce{MgO}
    \cite{farrell2015}.
Furthermore, it is tried to improve the ohmic behavior of the contacts of the thin films.
