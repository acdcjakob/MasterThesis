%! motivation
As described in the previous chapter, the resistivity of the \cro\ thin films shows strong dependence on thin film orientation.
To improve and taylor the conductivity, it is tried to incorporate acceptors into the \textit{p}-type material.
The elements chosen for this are lower valent \ce{Cu^2+} via \ce{CuO} and \ce{Zn^2+} via \ce{ZnO}, because doping has already been reported in literature on \textit{c}-plane sapphire with magnesium via \ce{MgO}
    \cite{farrell2015}.
% Furthermore, it is tried to reduce the sheet resistance of the contacts of the thin films.
