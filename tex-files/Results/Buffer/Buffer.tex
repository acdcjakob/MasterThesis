%! Motivation
A major motivation for investigating \cro\ thin films is a possible usage as buffer layer for isostructural \agao, which has similar lattice parameters:
\cro\ has a slightly larger $c$ and smaller $a$ lattice constant than \agao\ (Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_4_LatticeConstantsComp}).
This could improve the crystal quality of \agao\ thin films due to reduced lattice mismatch when compared to \ce{Al2O3}
    \cite{stepanov2021}.
For \textit{c}-plane, the mismatch of \agao\ to \alo\ and \cro\ is \qty{4.6}{\percent} and \qty{0.4}{\percent}, respectively.
As shown in chapter \ref{Sec:Results_Energy}, the in-plane compressive strain for \cro\ thin films on \textit{c}-plane \alo\ increases the mismatch beween \cro\ and \agao\ slightly for the pseudomorphic grown thin films.
However, when supplying sufficiently thick samples of at least \qty{150}{\nm}, this strain is negligible.
% Therefore, e.g., the in-plane compressive strain observed for \textit{c}-plane \cro\ thin films actually further decreases the mismatch between \cro\ and \agao.
On the other side, for \textit{m}-plane samples, the mismatch of \agao\ to \alo\ and \cro\ regarding the $c$-axis is \qty{3.3}{\percent} and \qty{-1.2}{\percent}, respectively.
As shown in the previous chapter, the in-plane compressive strain for \textit{m}-plane \cro\ thin films yields less discrepancy between the $c$ lattice constant of both sesquioxides.
A similiar argument can be drawn for \textit{a}-plane samples.
In the following, a proof of concept will be given that \agao\ can be successfully deposited on \cro\ buffer layers.
