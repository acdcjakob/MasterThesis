\enquote{Chromia} or \enquote{Eskolaite} is a sesquioxide composed of the transition metal chro\-mi\-um and oxygen with formula unit \ce{Cr2O3}.
Among other chromium oxides (e.g. metallic \ce{CrO2}, toxic \ce{CrO3} etc.), it is the thermodynamically most stable phase 
    \cite{lebreau2014,robbert1998,al-kuhaili2007},
making it the abundant chromium oxide on earth
    \cite{mi2018}.
\ce{Cr2O3} occurs mainly in the \textalpha-phase (described below), but a cubic spinel \textgamma-phase with random missing \ce{Cr} point defects has also been reported
    \cite{robbert1998}.
Henceforth, \enquote{\ce{Cr2O3}} will refer to the \textalpha-phase.

% Miscellaneous
As coating material, \ce{Cr2O3} is commonly used due to its high hardness and resistance against corrison \cite{singh2019,al-kuhaili2007}, also explaining its use-case as component of stainless steel to form passive films \cite{lebreau2014}.
\ce{Cr2O3} thin films absorb electromagnetic waves with wavelengths smaller than \qty{400}{\nm}, making it opaque in the \acrshort{UV}-spectrum \cite{cheng1996,guillen2021}.
It is transparent in the visible spectrum with, e.g., a reported transmittance of \qty{40}{\percent} at \qty{700}{\nm} for \qty{0.5}{\um} thick films by \citeauthor{cheng1996}~(\citeyear{cheng1996}) \cite{cheng1996}.

% crystal structure
\ce{Cr2O3} crystallizes in the corundum structure, which has trigonal symmetry (space group $R\bar{3}c$) and belongs to the hexagonal crystal family.
One unit cell contains six formula units, i.e. 12 chromium cations and 18 oxygen anions
    \cite{lebreau2014}.
The oxygen atoms arrange in a hexagonal close-packed manner, where two thirds of the formed octahedrons are filled with \ce{Cr} atoms
    \cite{catti1996}.
The unit cell is spanned by a principal axis, called \textit{c}-axis\footnote{The spins of the \ce{Cr} atoms along this direction are alternating $3\uparrow$ and $3\downarrow$ \cite{kehoe2016}, making the crystal antiferromagnetic \cite{catti1996,lebreau2014}.}, and a hexagonal basal plane with lattice constant \textit{a}.
The numerical values for those lattice parameters differ depending on the publication \cite{finger1980,arca2013,kehoe2016,mi2018,stepanov2021}, and we will use the values in Tab.~\ref{Tab:sesquiLatticeConstants}.

\paragraph{Electronic Structure}
Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that chromia exhibits a band gap of \qtyrange{3.2}{3.4}{\eV}
    \cite{mi2018,robbert1998,lebreau2014,arca2013}
making it a wide band gap material.
% Numerical calculations locate the smallest direct band gap at the $M$-point (Brillouin zone edge in $\langle10.0\rangle$-direction).
This predicts insulating behavior \cite{arca2013}, classified as both Mott-Hubbard type and charge-transfer type, which are models to describe the electronic behavior of compounds containing transition metals with partly filled $3d^n$ orbitals\footnote{$n=5$ for \ce{Cr}}
    \cite{catti1996,mi2018,lebreau2014}:
\gls{dft} calculations show that the \ce{Cr}-$3d$ states are almost solely responsible for electronic states in the conduction band and that they are also present in the valence band
    \cite{mi2018,lebreau2014}.
Thus, $3d\longrightarrow 3d$ band transitions are possible, favoring the Mott-Hubbard model of this compound
    \cite{lebreau2014}.
Furthermore, the \ce{O}-$2p$ states are mainly present in the valence band, at similar energies as the \ce{Cr}-$3d$ states, which leads to hybridization and thus favoring the charge-transfer model
    \cite{lebreau2014}.

% p-type of undoped Cr2O3 due to defects
However, several studies agree on \ce{Cr2O3} being a semiconductor with \textit{p}-type conductivity\footnote{
    \citeauthor{cheng2001a} (\citeyear{cheng2001a}) actually find \ce{Cr2O3} to be insulating. It is noted that they examined \ce{Cr2O3} as an \qty{2}{\nm} thick oxide surface on \ce{CrO2} films deposited by \gls{cvd} \cite{cheng2001a}.
    \citeauthor{farrell2015} (\citeyear{farrell2015}) also find that their high quality epitaxial films of \ce{Cr2O3} grown by \gls{mbe} exhibit no \textit{p}-type conductivity \cite{farrell2015}.
    Similar results were found by \citeauthor{kehoe2016} (\citeyear{kehoe2016}) for \gls{mbe} and \gls{pld} deposited films \cite{kehoe2016}.
}
at room temperature and atmospheric conditions
    \cite{kofstad1980,cheng1996,caricato2010,lebreau2014,mi2018,singh2019,polyakov2022a}.
Calculating the impact of different crystal point defects on the band structure may give insight into these observations.
Indeed, when considering a missing chromium atom (\enquote{vacancy} $V_{\ce{Cr}}$) the band structure changes in two ways:
The band gap itself is reduced \cite{mi2018}, but not in a way that it would make excitations of valence electrons into the conduction band much more probable than at room temperature.
But additionally, there is a new band introduced slightly above the Fermi level (cf. Fig.~\ref{Fig:lebreau2014_acceptorLevel}), which acts as an unoccupied acceptor level
    \cite{mi2018}.
This defect state is mainly composed of \ce{O}-$2p$ orbitals of the oxygen anions surrounding the vacancy
    \cite{lebreau2014}.
From a more intuitive point of view, a missing neutral chromium atom effectively removes the \ce{Cr^3+} cation as well as three electrons bound to the adjacent \ce{O^2-} anions, thus creating three holes \cite{lebreau2014} explaining the \textit{p}-type conductivity.
\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{lebreau2014_acceptorLevel}
    \caption{Calculated \acrfull{DOS} of chromia, taking a $V_{\ce{Cr}}$ into account.
    The arrow marks the new acceptor level.
    Image taken from \cite{lebreau2014}.}
    \label{Fig:lebreau2014_acceptorLevel}
\end{figure}

Note that there are also other possible defects with different effects:
a chromium Frenkel point defect describes a \ce{Cr} atom leaving it's position and occupying a formerly unoccupied cavity in one of the oxygen-octahedrons.
This Frenkel defect actually creates a new band right below the Fermi level, acting as an occupied donor level
    \cite{lebreau2014}.
A similar defect state is introduced by oxygen vacancies
    \cite{mi2018}.
But note that the Fermi level is located only slightly above the \gls{vbm} and thus the new occupied donor level is not significantly closer to the \gls{cbm}, which means that electrons still have to overcome the band gap energy to get into conducting states.
This favors the formation of holes via \ce{Cr} vacancies (\ce{O}-$2p$ acceptor states) rather than electrons via \ce{Cr} Frenkel defects and \ce{O} vacancies (\ce{Cr}-$3d$ donor states).

% --- Doping ---
\paragraph{Doping}
Several attempts have been made to alter the conductivity of chromia thin films, including incorporation of magnesium, nickel, or lithium to achieve better \textit{p}-type conductivity
    \cite{farrell2015}.
On the other hand, incorporating titanium seems to yield electrons as majority carriers 
    \cite{holt1994}
due to the higher valent state of \ce{Ti} when substituting \ce{Cr} sites (\ce{Ti_{Cr}})
    \cite{kofstad1980}.

Due to interest in the electrical properties of \textit{p}-type \glspl{tco}, the influence on \ce{Mg}-doped \ce{Cr2O3} thin films has been investigated by several studies
    \cite{holt1994,uekawa1996,arca2011,arca2013,farrell2015,arca2017,kehoe2016}.
Substituting \ce{Cr} atoms with less valent hole providers -- compared to structural defects of pure \ce{Cr2O3} -- does not only allow for a more controlled defect incorporation, but is also energetically more favorable due to a lower formation energy of \ce{Mg_{Cr}} compared to $V_{\ce{Cr}}$
    \cite{kehoe2016}.
\citeauthor{uekawa1996} (\citeyear{uekawa1996}) report an increase in conductivity of five orders of magnitude for \ce{Cr2O3{:}Mg} thin films
    \cite{uekawa1996}.
This result can be further improved by postannealing
    \cite{farrell2015}
and deposition at higher oxygen partial pressures
    \cite{holt1994,farrell2015}.
These effects are attributed to homogenization of magnesium inside the thin films and increased \ce{MgO} incorporation during deposition, respectively.
An observed side-effect of \ce{Mg}-doping is a color change to a brownish tint
    \cite{uekawa1996,arca2013}.
\Citeauthor{uekawa1996} (\citeyear{uekawa1996}) discuss that this may be the result of a mixed valence state of chromium (\ce{Cr^4+} or \ce{Cr^6+}), formed upon doping, as observed by \gls{xps}.
This may establish an unoccupied state, favoring charge-transfer transitions from \ce{O}-$2p$ orbitals to this low-energetic state, resulting in a different visual appearence of the thin films.
However, it has been shown that the overall transparency can be increased by codoping of \ce{Mg} with nitrogen which also reduces the decolorization substantially
    \cite{arca2011,arca2013}.
