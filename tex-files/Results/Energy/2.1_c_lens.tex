The \gls{oop}\ strain calculated via \eqref{Equ:Results_oop_strain_def} for all samples of the 1st batch is displayed in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensStrain}.
Consider the \textit{c}-plane oriented samples of the 1st batch that had a fixed lens position yielding a fluence of approx.\ \qty{2}{\joule\per\cm\squared}, but varying thickness (\textcolor{col-L-2}{$\blacksquare$} in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensStrain}).
A clear dependence of the \gls{oop}\ strain can be observed: thinner samples yield higher strain.
The layers become relaxed for thicknesses above approx.\ \qty{170}{\nm}.
For low thicknesses, the strain approaches the predicted value for pseudomorphic growth of \cro\ on \ce{Al2O3}, which is \qty{3.90}{\percent} (cf.\ Tab.\,\ref{tab:d_strained}).

%! RSMs strain
The recorded \glspl{RSM} of the (02.\underline{10}) reflection can confirm that this observation of \gls{oop}\ strain is due to pseudomorphic growth.
In Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_cRSMs}, one can observe a shift of $q_\parallel^{(02.10)}$ to higher values for lower thicknesses.
This corresponds to a decrease of the \gls{ip}\ lattice constant, which is the expected behavior for pseudomorphic growth, because the \gls{ip}\ $a$ lattice constant of \textit{c}-oriented \ce{Al2O3} is \qty{0.2}{\angstrom} smaller than for \cro\ (cf.\ Tab.\,\ref{Tab:sesquiLatticeConstants}).
The tensile \gls{oop}\ strain observed via \thetaomega-scans can also be confirmed by the fact that the \gls{oop}\ component $q_\perp^{(02.10)}$ is decreasing for thinner samples.
The reduction of signal intensity is attributed to the thickness, but could also be a result of decreasing crystal quality (cf.\ Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensOmega}).

\textcite{makushko2022} reported a similar behavior for \textit{c}-plane \cro\ thin films deposited via magnetron sputtering.
They varied the thin film thickness from \qtyrange{30}{250}{\nm}, which is comparable to this work.
In \gls{TEM} measurements, they could observe that dislocations started forming approx.\ \qty{5}{\nm} away from the \cro--\alo\ interface, indicating a highly strained pseudomorphic layer.
This could also be observed as a very sharp peak in reciprocal space, identified by an alignment of $q_\parallel$ with the  corresponding asymmetric reciprocal space vector of the substrate.
Note that this peak cannot be observed for the here presented samples.
A reason for this could be that \citeauthor{makushko2022} observed this for thin films with thickness of \qty{30}{\nm} only.
Every film but the thinnest in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_cRSMs} exceed this critical thickness.
Another reason for the missing sharp peak could be that the herein probed (02.\underline{10}) plane has only \qty{50}{\percent} of the intensity of the (10.\underline{10}) reflection
    \cite[mp-19399]{MaterialsProject}.

When looking into the remaining samples that were fabricated with larger laser spot sizes but similar thickness of \qty{50}{\nm} (bluish squares in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensStrain}), it becomes clear that the \gls{oop}\ strain is also slightly reduced for lower fluences.
But note that this effect is less dominant when compared to the influence of thickness.

%! omega
In Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensOmega}, the \textomega-FWHM of \textit{c}-plane samples is depicted in dependence on the film thickness and laser fluence for the 1st batch.
As before, consider the samples with smallest laser spot size and therefore largest fluence first (\textcolor{col-L-2}{$\blacksquare$}):
increasing the thickness is clearly correlated to a decreasing \textomega-FWHM.
Therefore, thicker samples yield \emph{both} less strained and more crystalline films.
This is an unexpected result, because as shown in section \ref{Sec:Theory_Relaxed}, relaxation is mediated by dislocations which should worsen the crystal quality.
Note that there is an outlier to this behavior for the sample with a thickness of approx.\ \qty{30}{\nm}.
When considering the \textomega-pattern of this sample (Fig.\,\ref{Fig:App_3_cOmegaOutlier}a), it becomes clear that the non-\textsc{Voigt} shape makes the determination of \gls{FWHM} difficult.
Therefore, not too much attention should be paid to this data point.
When considering the samples fabricated with lower fluences (bluish squares in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensOmega}), a much more dominant influence of laser spot size on the crystallinity can be observed.

%! correlation
This can be summarized by stating that the thickness of the samples is the dominant influence on the \gls{oop}\ strain, because the thickest samplest yielded less strain than the thinner samples with lowest fluence (Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensStrain}).
However, for the \textomega-FWHM, the reverse is observed, namely that even the thickest samples (which exhibit better quality than thinner samples of the same lens position) have a much higher \textomega-FWHM when compared to thinner samples fabricated with less fluence.
This can be seen in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_3_lensCorrelation}, where the \textomega-FWHM is visualized depending on the \gls{oop}\ strain of the corresponding sample:
A linear behavior (correlation) is observed for each set fluence; but there are two different regimes in total, with the high-fluence regime generally showing higher \textomega-FWHM.
