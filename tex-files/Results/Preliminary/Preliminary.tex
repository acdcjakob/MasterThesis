%! Motivation / Intro
In the following, the feasibility of depositing \cro\ thin films via \gls{pld} as well as their resulting properties are investigated.
Since \textalpha-\cro\ is the only phase of chromia (cf.~\ref{Sec:Cr2O3}), it is expected that the growth results in either rhombohedral or amorphous films.
Furthermore, if a crystalline phase is present, the orientation with respect to the sapphire substrates is of interest.
Because \alo\ and \cro\ exhibit the same crystal symmetry, it is expected that the crystal orientation of the film  matches the corresponding substrate orientation.
Finally, deposition parameters should be optimized to obtain the best crystal quality.
