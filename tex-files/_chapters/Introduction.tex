\chapter{Introduction}
%! Einordnung
Semiconductor technology today is based on the versatility of silicon: its band gap of \qty{1.1}{\eV} is large enough to allow tayloring its conductivity from semi-insulating to conductive -- on the other hand, its small enough to be doped both \textit{p}-type or \textit{n}-type.
Even though being present in a vast range of applications, todays technological requirements push silicon to its limits:
power switching applications and high-frequency electronics are strongly dependent on the electrical field at which breakdown occurs
    \cite{higashiwaki2018}.
This critical field strength however is correlated to the band gap of the underlying material
    \cite{slobodyan2022},
which is why \acrfull{uwbg} materials have gained much attention:
Those semiconductors can provide the necessary properties which are needed, for example, in the optimization of charging and motor drive efficiency in electric vehicles
    \cite{gupta2024}
-- which itself is an important step towards lowering emissions.

One interesting \acrshort{uwbg} semiconductor is \gao, which turned out to be a viable material for solar-blind UV detectors
    \cite{singhpratiyush2017},
power rectifiers
    \cite{yang2017},
power MOSFETs
    \cite{moser2017}
and gas sensors
    \cite{ogita2001}.
Its thermodynamically most stable \textbeta-phase ($E_g=4.6-\qty{5.0}{\eV}$) has been extensively studied, but the \textalpha-phase has an even higher band gap of up to \qty{5.3}{\eV}
    \cite{hassa2021a}.
This metastable \gao\ phase crystallizes in the corundum structure, making it isostructural to cost-efficient and readily available sapphire (\alo) substrates.
However, there is still a lattice mismatch of \qty{4.6}{\percent} between \agao\ and \alo, regarding the $a$-constant.
This introduces a large amount of threading dislocations
    \cite{kaneko2012},
which strongly reduces the mobiltiy in \agao\ thin fillms
    \cite{takane2023}.
Additionally, due to similar growth conditions of the \textkappa-phase, phase pure deposition of \agao\ is a challenge for different growth techniques
    \cite{bosi2020}.
Several attempts have been undertaken to overcome these technical aspects of deposition, namely epitaxial lateral overgrowth
    \cite{kawara2020}
and growth on patterned substrates
    \cite{nikolaev2020}
or buffer layers
    \cite{jinno2016,jinno2018}.

A promising buffer layer material for \agao\ is chromium oxide (\cro), which is isomorphic to \agao\ with a very low lattice mismatch of only \qty{0.4}{\percent} regarding the $a$-constant -- one order of magnitude lower compared to \alo.
The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated with \acrfull{hvpe}
    \cite{stepanov2021,polyakov2022,polyakov2022a,butenko2023},
a \acrfull{cvd} method also widely applied for successfully depositing phase pure \agao\ thin films on several sapphire orientations
    \cite{jinno2020}.
\cro\ is also interesting due to its defect-induced \textit{p}-type nature, which can be enhanced by doping with lower valent cations
    \cite{arca2011,arca2013,arca2017,farrell2015}.
Because it is virtually impossible to achieve \textit{p}-type \gao\
    \cite{pearton2018},
\cro\ is a candidate for both \textit{p}-type alloys with \agao, similar to \ce{(Ir,Ga)2O3}
    \cite{kaneko2021},
and \textit{p}-\textit{n} heterostructures with very low lattice mismatch at the interface
    \cite{polyakov2022a}.

%! aim of this work
Because \acrfull{pld} is a promising \acrfull{pvd} method for fabricating \agao\ thin films and devices
    \cite{petersen2023,vogt2023,vogt2024},
the aim of this work is to show the feasibility of preparing \cro\ thin films via \acrshort{pld}.
Therefore, the growth window of thin film growth depending on oxygen partial pressure, growth temperature and substrate orientation is investigated (chapter \ref{Sec:Results_Preliminary}).
Detailled structural analysis via \glspl{RSM} is done for thin films fabricated with various laser energy densities during deposition (chapter \ref{Sec:Results_Energy}).
Furthermore, a segmented target approach is utilized to aim for tailored conductivities of Zn- and Cu-doped \cro\ thin films (chapter \ref{Sec:Results_Doping}).
Finally, it is shown that \agao\ can be deposited phase pure on \cro\ buffer layers in \textit{c}-, \textit{r}-, \textit{m}- and \textit{a}-orientation (chapter \ref{Sec:Results_Buffer}).
Before analyzing the results of those experiments, a short overview will be given on the here investigated sesquioxides, as well as the basics of \acrfull{XRD} and heteroepitaxy of rhombohedral materials.
