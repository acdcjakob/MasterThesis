# Tasks
## XRD part
1. Read through similar thesis' and extract important infos
	- ~~short: how are X-rays produced~~
	- ~~properties of reciprocal lattice vectors~~
	- ~~calculation of lattice plane distance~~
	- ~~scattering geometry explained in Laue-style~~
	- what can be probed (harrington paper)
2. ~~try to reorder what is already written in XRD-note (cite!)~~
3. ~~consider Ashcroft~~

## Cr2O3 part
Reading of related papers and extracting information on pure Cr2O3:
- crystal structure and phases
- electronic structure
	- band (modification)
	- conduction
- growth techniques
- miscellaneous
	- optical properties
	- coating use

Checking out other materials intros, what do I miss?
- use-cases for devices
- chapter about Ga2O3


## Outlining the Thesis

Tasks to do:
- [x] reading through some related thesis ToC's and collect:
	- theory parts (+length)
 	- method parts (+length)
- [x] write down proposal of own theory / methods part with approx. length
