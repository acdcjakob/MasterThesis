In the following, the results for the samples produced at four different oxygen partial pressures are analyzed.
In Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_pressure_2theta}, the \thetaomega-patterns are depicted.
For each pattern, the two peaks (solid line) at around \qty{68}{\degree} correspond to the (30.0) reflection of the \textit{m}-plane oriented sapphire substrate.
The splitting occurs due to the similar wavelength of \ce{Cu}-K\textalpha\textsubscript{1} and \ce{Cu}-K\textalpha\textsubscript{2} radiation.
The additional peaks also stem mainly from the (30.0) reflection of \ce{Al2O3} and are caused by
\ce{W}-L\textbeta\textsubscript{2}-,
\ce{W}-L\textbeta\textsubscript{1}-,
\ce{Cu}-K\textbeta-,
\ce{W}-L\textalpha\textsubscript{1}- and
\ce{W}-L\textalpha\textsubscript{2}-radiation (increasing angles).\footnote{

}
In the vicinity of the calculated peak position for the (30.0) reflection of \cro\ (cf.~\ref{tab:d_strained}), there is a peak observed for each sample, indicating that the \textalpha-phase of \cro\ is present.
Note that the peak position is varying depending on the chosen oxygen partial pressure.
The difference to the expected peak position $2\theta_0$ is expressed as \gls{oop}\ strain $\epsilon_{zz}$ using the Bragg equation Equ.\,\ref{Equ:Theory_BraggCondition} and then
\begin{equation}
    \label{Equ:Results_oop_strain_def}
    \epsilon_{zz}
    =\frac{d-d_0}{d_0}
    =\left(\frac{1}{\sin(2\theta/2)}-\frac{1}{\sin(2\theta_0/2)}\right)
    \cdot\sin(2\theta_0/2)\,.
\end{equation}
In Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_both_strainFWHM}a, the calculated strain is shown in dependence of the corresponding oxygen partial pressure.
The strain decreases from approx.\ \qty{0.95}{\percent} to \qty{0.45}{\percent} with increasing pressure.
This strain reduction may therefore be the result of increased background gas scattering which results in less kinetic energy of the specimen reaching the heated substrate (cf.~\ref{Sec:Methods_pld}).

%! omega-scans
For each sample, the $2\theta$ angle was fixed to the observed (30.0) reflection of \cro\ and an \textomega-scan was performed.
The \glspl{FWHM} of the \textomega-patterns (henceforth \enquote{\textomega-FWHM}) are depicted in
    Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_both_strainFWHM}b.
The values vary between approx.\ \qtylist{30;50}{\arcminute} and show a dependence on oxygen partial pressure, which is less pronounced compared with \gls{oop}\ strain
    (Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_both_strainFWHM}a).
Still, since \textomega-FWHM is connected to the mosaicity of the thin film, higher oxygen partial pressures yield slightly better crystal qualities.
Note that due to the fact that an oxygen partial pressure of \qty{1e-3}{\milli\bar} yielded the best crystal quality, this value is used for future deposition processes.

%! phi-scan
To probe for rotational domains of the thin films, \textphi-scans were performed by fixing $2\theta$ and $\omega$ to the corresponding angles of the (30.6) plane of \cro, which has an inclination angle of \qty{32.4}{\degree} with respect to the (30.0) plane.
The diffraction patterns are depicted in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_phiScan}.
The observed peaks of the thin film align with the peaks of the single crystal substrate, indicating that the film has no in-plane rotation with respect to the substrate.
Furthermore, the absence of additional peaks indicates that there exists only a single domain of the thin film.

%! growth rates
The growth rate $g$ varies between \qtylist{3;7}{\pm\per\pulse} and is depicted in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_growthRates_photograph}a.
No systematic dependence on the oxygen partial pressure can be observed.

%! Transmission
The transmission spectra of two selected \cro\ thin films are shown in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_transmission}a.
The samples are not fully transparent in the visible spectrum and they exhibit a greenish tint, as can also be seen in Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_growthRates_photograph}b.

% mi2018 states cr2o3 is a direct bandgap semiconductor
To determine the onset of absorption $E_\tau$, a \textsc{Tauc}-plot (Fig.\,\ref{Fig:Results_1_transmission}b) is utilized (cf.~\ref{Sec:Methods_transmission}).
The exponent is chosen to be $\frac{1}{2}$, resulting in a representation of $(\alpha E)^2$ vs.\ $E$.
Although the publications used for reference in this work support the direct transition nature of \cro\ 
    \cite{farrell2015,mi2018},
it has to be noted that there exist studies determining the optical band gap of \cro\ by applying an exponent of 2, assuming an indirect band gap transition for \cro\ 
    \cite{cheng1996,al-kuhaili2007}.
Fitting the linear regime in the onset of absorption results in $E_\tau\approx\qty{3.7}{\eV}$ for both samples, which differ in strain and \textomega-FWHM by a factor of approx. 2 and 0.3, respectively.
