The incorporation of \ce{CuO} or \ce{ZnO} had no effect on the conductivity of \textit{c}- and \textit{r}-plane oriented \cro\ thin films.
None of the \textit{m}- or \textit{a}-plane oriented films became conductive.
However, the conductivity depends strongly on the crystallinity, which indicates intrinsic defects as the origin of charge carriers.
The crystallinity is mainly influenced by laser fluence and target degradation due to repeated ablation with the same laser spot position on the target.
This results in both lower growth rates and presumably less kinetic energy of the plasma species which deposits on the substrate.
Even though the doping attempt showed no effect, a discrete material library of \cro\ thin films with different strains was provided.
A fundamental difference between \textit{c}-plane and the other common orientations was observed, regarding the origin of the observed \gls{oop}\ strain.
Further measurements must be conducted to deconvolute the effects of (i) thickness, (ii) laser fluence on target and (iii) target degradation.
