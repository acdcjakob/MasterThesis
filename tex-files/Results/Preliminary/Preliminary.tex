To study the properties of \cro\ thin films, it has to be investigated whether the material can be deposited via \gls{pld}.
Since \textalpha-\cro\ is the only phase of chromia (cf.~\ref{Sec:Cr2O3}), it is expected that the growth results in either rhombohedral or amorphous films.
Furthermore, if a crystalline phase is present, the orientation with respect to the sapphire substrates is of interest.
Because \alo\ and \cro\ exhibit the same crystal symmetry, it is expected that the crystal orientation of the film  matches the corresponding substrate orientation.
Finally, deposition parameters should be optimized to obtain the best crystal quality.
